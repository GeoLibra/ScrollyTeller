0,50,0,50,This is scrolling <strong>'Narration'</strong> in ScrollyTeller,,,,containerStyle.opacity:0,,,,
1,40,40,80,Narration Blocks,Each 'narration block' contains several elements,,,containerStyle.opacity:0,,,,
outline,40,40,80,title,"This is a <strong>narration-block</strong>, which contains a <strong>TITLE</strong>, some <strong>paragraph content</strong> (this text block), and a link , which is shown below.",https://stash.ihme.washington.edu/projects/VIZ/repos/scrolly-teller/browse,Link to ScrollyTeller repo,containerStyle.opacity:0;containerClass:dashed|true;,,,,
3,40,40,80,Graph Container,"To the right (or wherever your CSS places it) is a graph area consisting of a container div (class=graph_container), which is shown in the dashed outline.",,,containerStyle.opacity:1;graphStyle.opacity:0;containerClass:dashed;,,,,
3,40,40,80,Graph,"And a graph div (class=graph_default), shown by the solid box.",,,containerStyle.opacity:1;graphStyle.opacity:1;graphStyle.background-color:lightgray;containerClass:dashed;,,,,
5,40,40,80,Titles and Captions,"Titles (class=graph_title) and captions (class=graph_caption) can be optionally added in the container div, and changed per-narration block.",,,code:,,This is a title,This is a caption,
4,40,40,80,Triggers,ScrollyTeller helps us use simple text-based triggers stored in a CSV file to trigger actions in the graph area. <br><br>Actions are triggered when a narration block hits the middle of the page and becomes active.,,,containerClass:dashed|remove,,This is a title,This is a caption,
3,40,40,80,This block contiains a trigger that turns the graph background to blue,ScrollyTeller has some built in triggers that can be used to change styles of the the graph_container and its contents.,,,graphStyle.background-color:blue;,,This is a title,This is a caption,
5,40,40,80,Styling Titles and Captions,Titles and captions can be styled using the special trigger keywords <strong>titleStyle</strong> and <strong>captionStyle</strong>.  Here we've changed the title font size and changed the font color to gray using the trigger string: <strong>titleStyle.font-size:2.1rem;titleStyle.color:darkgray;</strong>,,,code:;titleStyle.font-size:2.1rem;titleStyle.color:darkgray;,,This is a title with styling controlled by the <strong>titleStyle</strong> trigger,This is a caption,
5,40,40,80,Trigger Handling Code,This function in the ScrollyTeller section configuration receives the trigger and handles the opacity and the background color of the graph area.<br><br>(see: onActivateNarrationFunction() in the file: demo_app/exampleSection0/ exampleSection0.js of the ScrollyTeller repo),,,code:onActivate;graphStyle.background-color:transparent,,,,
5,40,40,80,Using Scroll Progress,We can also use a progress variable (0-1) to smoothly transition things.  Here we created a trigger called 'graph:fadeout' to smoothly transition the opacity of the graph out.,,,graphStyle.opacity:calc(1 - $progress);containerStyle.background-color:transparent,,,,
5,40,40,80,Using Scroll Progress,"And if we can make a 'graph:fadeout', we can make a 'graph:fadein' to smoothly transition the opacity of the graph back in.",,,code:onScroll;graphStyle.opacity:$progress,,,,
5,40,40,80,Using Scroll Progress,"This function in the ScrollyTeller section configuration receives the trigger as scrolling occurs, and we write a switch statement to handle the opacity based on the progress of the narration through the page. <br><br>(see: onScrollFunction() in the file: demo_app/exampleSection0/ exampleSection0.js of the ScrollyTeller repo)",,,code:onScroll;containerStyle.background-color:transparent,,,,
9,40,40,80,End of the first section,"This is the last narration block in 'ExampleSection0'.  In the next section, we will look at how we can get data for a graph, then use triggers to create actions within graphs.",,,containerStyle.opacity:0,,,,
